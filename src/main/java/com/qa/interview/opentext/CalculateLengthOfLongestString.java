/* Concatenation is an operation that joins Strings. For example, the concatenation of Strings "smart" and "phone" is
 * "smartphone". Concatenation can be expanded to more than two Strings; for example Concatenation "co", "dil" and "ity"
 * results in "codility".
 * 
 * Given an Array A consisting of Strings, your function should calculate the length of the longest String S such that:
 * 		1. S is a Concatenation of some of the strings from A;
 * 		2. every letter in S is different.
 * 
 * Write a function that, given an Array A consisting of N Strings, calculate the length of the longest String S fulfiling
 * the conditions above. If no such String exists your function should return 0.
 * 
 * 	1. Given A = ["co", "dil", "ity"], your function should return 5. The resulting String S could be, "codil", "dilco",
 * 		"coity" or "ityco".
 * 	2. Given A = ["abc", "yyy", "def", "csv"], your function should return 6. The resulting String S could be "abcdef",
 * 		"defabc", "defcsv" or "csvdef".
 * 	3. Given A = ["potato", "kayak", "banana", "racecar"], your function should return 0. It is impossible to choose any
 * 		of these Strings as each of them contains repeating letter.
 * 	4. Given A = ["eva", "jqw", "tyn", "jan"], your function should return 9. One of the possible Strings of this length
 * 		is "evajqwtyn".
 * 
 * Assume that:
 * 		1. N is an integer with the range [1..8];
 * 		2. each String in A consists of lowercase English letters;
 * 		3. the sum of lengths of Strings in A does not exceed 100.
